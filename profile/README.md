## The four essential freedoms

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).

* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

And please see [Free Software Definition page](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
